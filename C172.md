<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>

</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>

<li>Potentially <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C836.md">C836 – Fundamentals of Information Security</a></li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam. In order to pass, you need to pass the 69 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects <b>Introduction to Networking Concepts</b> for 38%, <b>Introduction to Network Security</b> for 33%, and <b>Network Security Operations</b> for 29% of the assesement.</p> 


<br />

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>This class was an absolute slog. Not only was the UCertify dry and difficult to get through, but I failed the Objective Assessment twice. I was lucky however that during my time taking the class I was able to switch to a new version of the course which reset my exam attempts and also removed some of the harder parts of the original material such as subnetting and replaced it with concepts from C836 – Fundamentals of Information Security.</p>
<p>The irony to all of this of course, was that in order to pass this exam, I actually ended up using C836's UCertify which is a far more interesting and quicker read. The Security aspects of Networking I felt were just far easier for me to grasp than subnetting. Beyond that, I also struggled to find learning resources that could make the concepts click for me. I tried the CompTIA Network+ series that everyone spoke so highly about, but no amount of colorful props could make the concepts stick. Luckily, with the switch to the new version of C172, I also found a series of courses on Plurasight that not only helped those difficult concepts click, but it made me appreciate the field of Networking.</p>
<p>If you're new to WGU, it's possible that this course may have undergone another change. Like <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C958.md">C958 - Calculus I</a>, C172 is a very "fat" course that may new students get stuck on. They've been trying to balance the course's difficult and the difficult concepts that are necessary to understand Networking for a while. So, by the time you take it they may have lowered the weight of the Security section. The links I'm going to include should be useful regardless.</p>
<p>And a final note. If C172 is making you feel stressed out or like you want to quit, don't. I failed the OA four times (through two different versions) before I was able to pass it. Because it was in the first semester along with C958 when I started, it held me back from progressing as far as a lot of the other students who started during the first big BSCS wave I enrolled during. In fact, many of them are probably already graduates. My point is, don't give up! This degree program has some obnoxiously tough courses in it, but you will pass them! Hopefully this repo will be the path that leads you to that finish line.</p>

<h5>Textbooks:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/164093092">Network & Security - Foundations UCertify</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the UCertify for the class. It likely has changed since I passed this course. The two versions I used were very dry and difficult to get through. The one saving grace is that the course instructors stuffed in a number of very useful videos into it that explained the material better than the text did.</li>
  <li><a href="https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/114581836">Fundamentals of Information Security UCertify</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the UCertify for the class. This UCertify is absolutely fantastic and helped me pass not one, but three courses. C172, C836, and <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C961.md">C961 – Ethics in Technology</a>. I was lucky that when I began you could activate every course and access the course materials early, but that's since been changed. If you're new to the program I recommend asking your program mentor to either allow you to take C836 BEFORE this course, or to allow you to take it concurrently.</li>
