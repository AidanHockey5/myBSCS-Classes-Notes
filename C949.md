| Prerequisites: | Required For: | Transfer Information: | Recommended Course Order: |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| No prerequisites are required for this course.<sup>[1]</sup> | [Title](CXXX.md)<sup>[1]</sup> | One course, equivalent to 4 units, in data structures and/or an advanced course in algorithms.<sup>[2]</sup> | After [C173 - Scripting and Programming - Foundations](C173.md), but before [C867 - Scripting and Programming - Applications](C867.md). Take with [C959 - Discrete Mathematics I](C959.md) if possible.|

##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Data Structures and Algorithms I covers the fundamentals of dynamic data structures, such as bags, lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and their associated algorithms. With Python software as the basis, the course discusses object-oriented design and abstract data types as a design paradigm.* 

*The course emphasizes problem solving and techniques for designing efficient, maintainable software applications. Students will implement simple applications using the techniques learned.This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.*
- *The graduate determines the appropriate implementation of data types to design efficient and maintainable software.*
- *The graduate determines which dynamic data structures are applicable for developing scalable software.*
- *The graduate decides on an efficient algorithm for developing usable software.

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the XX question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:
- Competency for XX%

## My Experiences with Class
This course used to show up very late in the program, behind even the [Discrete](C959.md) [Math](C960.md) classes, right before its partner class, C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms II. However, I've heard that it's recently been pushed up on the degree plan in a similar fashion that [C955 - Applied Probability and Statistics](C955.md) has. If your degree plan doesn't reflect this, I suggest asking your Program Mentor if you can take this soon rather than later, because it's actually the best introductory to programming in the degree program and the Zybooks is everything that you SHOULD be learning before you take on any big programming projects.


That said, this course is by no means difficult. It's not the deep dive into Data Structures and Algorithms that C950 is, but an overview of what Data Structures are, what types exists, how they work, and how they're implemented. You will learn about Algorithms in this course, but it's more akin to what are Algorithms, what are the different types, and what do they when used. You'll be mostly focusing on Searching and Sorting Algorithms in particular and they WILL make up a large portion of the Objective Assessment.


You'll also learn about Big-O, which is a formula for how Algorithm efficiency is measured. You won't need to memorize the Big-O notation of every Algorithm that exists, but you will need to understand how to recognize the notation from a given sample of code. Aside from Big-O and Searching and Sorting Algorithms, you should make sure to pay extra attention to Trees Traversals, and the properties of every Data Structure (what it is, how it works, what can/can't it do).


Although the Zybooks is taught in Python, the exam itself is language agnostic, so you will need to be able to follow code samples more than understand the actual syntax of Python. At first glance it may look overwhelming, but with the Zybook and a few of the other resources below, you'll find this course is actually pretty easy. And, if you studied hard, the topics covered in this class will be one of the first big steps you take from being a *programmer* to *computer scientist*.
