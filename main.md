# myBSCS-Classes-Notes
A repo to store notes on classes from my Bachelors of Science degree program.

## Purpose
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WGU-BSCS/bscs-classes">current one</a> from the WGU BSCS group is empty and I don't recognize a lot of the course numbers from my BSCS program on it. So I decided to fill this repo up with notes and links to resources from classes I've taken and have yet taken, as well as my thoughts on them. Since I don't want to receive an academic strike or anything similar, I'm not going to be putting up projects or official documents. I want to ensure this repo can remain up for future students to use as guidance since an important selling factor of this school is the supportive student communities that exist and the advice they pass on from student to student.</p>
<br />

## Update
<p>Now that every course has its own page on the repo, I'm going to focus my attention to adding more learning resources for different learning styles, adding a page or so of more generalized study resources, keep up with changes to the courses, and general page maintanence. If you have any suggestions for things I should add to the repo, you can open an issue or pull request and I will get to it as soon as possible. If I've included a link to something you've written and would like it removed from the repo, please let me know in the same fashion and I will remove it immediately.</p>

<br />

## Classes
<p>Below is a list of the classes covered in this repo (with links to their readmes). I've seperated it by courses I've taken for the degree program and completed, courses I'm currently taking, and courses in the program I haven't taken yet. When I started this repo I opted to not make pages for courses I transfered in, I will be working towards making them in the future. After I complete the degree program I will change this page to have all courses listed in order of their order on the degree program standard path.</p>

 <p><sub>[3] I took the former certification-based version of this course. It has since been updated to an in-house exam. While my notes on the exam are outdated, a lot of the HTML and CSS practice links should still be helpful to those new to the subject.</sub></p>
