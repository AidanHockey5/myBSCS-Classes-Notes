<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam. In order to pass, you need to pass the 68 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects <b>Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages</b> for 4%, <b>Basic Algebra</b> for 10%, <b>Descriptive Statistics for a Single Variable</b> for 19%, <b>Descriptive Statistics for Two Variables</b> for 19%, <b>Correlation and Regression</b> for 22%, and <b>Probability</b> for 25% of the assessment.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>This course is a very easy, math general education course. If you've enrolled in the degree program recently, you'll likely have this course in your first term. When I started, this course was far in the back of the degree program along with <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C949.md">C949 - Data Structures and Algorithms I</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C836.md">C836 - Fundamentals of Information Security</a>, all three of which are actually far better introductory courses than <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C958.md">C958</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C867.md">C867</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C172.md">C172</a>. It's almost a joke that Calculus I was before this class because knowing Basic Algebra is important to understanding Calculus!</p>
<p>Enough about that however, if you have any previous experience with the topics; algebra, statistics, and probability, you'll likely be able to jump straight to the Objective Assessment and pass. If not, the textbook for this course actually isn't too bad and there's a lot of very helpful learning resources below.</p>
<p>Don't stress out about this course! And make sure you're comfortable with fractions and graphs for the Objective Assessment. Remember, while this is a math course and you can use a calculator, it won't do much to help if you don't understand HOW to do the problems.</p>
