<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>C165 is WGU's General Education science course. It's meant to give you a survey of the key physical science disciplines including Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Science. There's also a section on the Scientific Method that you will be expected to know about. Similar to <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C182.md">C182 Introduction to IT</a>, the content you're going to be learning in this class is really a surface level of all of these different fields, the issue a lot of people run into however is how much information you'll be expected to know. If you read the WGU official Textbook for the course, use the quizzes, and practice with the Quizlet, this should be an easy course to knock out for 3 credits.</p>
