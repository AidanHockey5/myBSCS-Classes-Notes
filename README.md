# BSCS Class Notes and Resources
A repository to store notes on classes from the Bachelors of Science degree program I'm currently enrolled in.

## Purpose
I decided to create my own repo of notes and resources for the BS in CS program I'm in after seeing the [current one](https://github.com/WGU-BSCS/bscs-classes) from the WGU BSCS group was empty and I didn't recognize a lot of the course numbers from my BSCS program on it. I've been an avid follower of the school subreddits and have followed the posts on many courses for the last few years, saving links to many for future reference. One day (as in, last week), I decided that I needed to start taking my studies far more seriously so I decided to learn GitHub and create repositories for notes on the classes I was taking. Eventually, after seeing the WGU BSCS's empty repo I decided I would create something similar to keep track of all of the links I'd been saving. And that's about it. 

Once I had a few readmes drafted up I decided to just turn it into a project to share with everyone else too. As it turns out, when you're taking a 100% online degree, pushing and pulling yourself through classes full of new concepts alone isn't super easy. A pretty big component of this university now is the amount of student-generated resources designed to help newer and struggling peers. So that's what this repo is. I'm hoping to compile all of the good stuff into a single place, organized in a way that no matter where you're at, you'll find something in here that'll get you past the finish line.

## How You Can Help
Obviously trying to figure out what resources will work for every kind of learner for every course and managing the updates to courses is already a challenge. For courses I've transfered in (and therefore have no idea what is important to study) and [courses that have significantly changed since I took them](C779.md) I have to rely on the observations and opinions of others. However, if you've taken one of those courses or even if you've found something helpful for a course that I don't have in here, please feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request. As long as it isn't something that could get this repo taken down or someone expelled (OA questions/answers, PA projects/papers, etc), you're good. Eventually I'll have a regular pull request guideline up...

## What's Coming Next
Well, lots of clean up. There's bound to be lots of typos all over the place and I'd really like to make everything a little more uniform. On the advice of @todgru , I'm going to be updating everything from the very clunky HTML I was using to the far more accessible [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) while doing so. Hopefully it will make collaborating on here a lot easier.

I'm also planning to add on an extra page for more general learning resources (like links to tools and documentation, some books and video courses to help bridge some of the gaps, etc). If you have any recommendations for that, check out the readme when I eventually post and slap it right [here](https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes).

Anything else? Yeah, I'm working on a chatbot to give people recommendations as to what class they should take next. (I see that question asked a lot in the subreddit). I might be putting out a questionaire to get some data for that sometime soon, so look out for that in case you'd like to participate. I'll be making a seperate repo for the chatbot that you can download and stage in PandoraBots. And no, it's not my C951 project, it's just something I'm building to learn how things work. Like I said above, no PA projects are welcome in this repo so it doesn't get shut down!

## Classes
Below is a list of the classes in the BSCS program. Everything that's linked has its own readme on this repo with information you might find helpful regarding said course. Links to write-ups by the reddit communities, learning resources, textbooks that might help, and some general information like what kind of course it is and, if I've completed it, a write-up of with my own thoughts on the course.

<sub>[C] - This symbol is to denote a course recently underwent a significant change, so the content on its readme may be slightly outdated in some areas. If you've taken it since the changes were implemented and would like to help us update the course page, please submit a pull request!</sub>

<sub>[N] - This symbol is to denote a course is new to the program and may not have a lot of resources for it yet. If you've taken it and would like to offer some advice or learning resources for the readme, please submit a pull request!</sub>

<sub>[X] - This symbol is to denote a course that does not yet have a readme page in the repo...but definitely will soon!</sub>
