| Prerequisites: | Required For: | Transfer Information: | Recommended Course Order: |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| No prerequisites are required for this course.<sup>[1]</sup> | No courses require this as a prerequisite<sup>[1]</sup> | One course, equivalent to 3 units, in physical science (chemistry, geology, physics, or astronomy).<sup>[2]</sup> | Take with [C683 - Natural Science Lab](C683.md) because of content overlap. |

<br />

##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*This course provides students with an overview of the basic principles and unifying ideas of the physical sciences: physics, chemistry, and earth sciences. Course materials focus on scientific reasoning and practical, everyday applications of physical science concepts to help students integrate conceptual knowledge with practical skills.* 

*This course covers the following competencies:**
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.* 
- *The graduate describes the nature and process of science.*
- *The graduate examines applications of physics including fundamental concepts such as forces, motion, energy, and waves.*
- *The graduate examines applications of key chemistry concepts including the structure of matter and the behavior and conservation of matter in chemical reactions.*
- *The graduate describes the underlying organization, interactions, and processes within the Earth system including the Earth's structure and atmosphere, and Earth's interactions within the solar system.*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses an exam. In order to complete the course, you need to pass the 70 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects which each account for a specified percentage of the total questions on the assessment:
- The Nature of Science for 20%
- Physics for 27% 
- Chemistry for 21% 
- Earth Science for 31%

## My Experiences with Class
C165 is WGU's General Education science course. It's meant to give you a survey of the key physical science disciplines including Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Science. There's also a section on the Scientific Method that you will be expected to know about. Similar to [C182 Introduction to IT](C182.md), the content you're going to be learning in this class is really a surface level of all of these different fields, the issue a lot of people run into however is how much information you'll be expected to know. If you read the WGU official Textbook for the course, use the quizzes, and practice with the Quizlet, this should be an easy course to knock out for 3 credits.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [WGU C165 Integrated Physical Sciences Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/213070013/wgu-c165-integrated-physical-sciences-flash-cards/) | Flash Cards | Like C182, by quizzing yourself with the Quizlet on the many vocabulary terms for the course should be about enough to pass. | 
| [Integrated Physical Science Textbook](https://wgu-nx.acrobatiq.com) | Textbook | When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the textbook for the class. It's not a long read and covers everything you'll need to know for this exam. Between this and the Quizlet, you'll be fine. |  
| [101science.com](http://101science.com/) | Website | Probably the greatest website on the internet for learning about science, if there's a concept you're struggling with this site will likely either have a section on it, a link to something better, or a book that can help you. |
