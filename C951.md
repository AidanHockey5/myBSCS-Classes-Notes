<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Project</h5>
<P>This course uses a programming project. In order to pass, you need to follow instructions provided on the course page to create and write documentation for two bots as well as a third paper (a proposal related to machine learning). Once you've finished your papers, you'll need to submit them to be evaluated and see whether it is accepted (and you pass).</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>Right now I don’t have any experience with this class because I haven’t enrolled in it yet. Hopefully if you’re looking for information, the awesome write-ups below from the WGU and WGU BSCS subreddits will help! I will update this when I can.</p>
