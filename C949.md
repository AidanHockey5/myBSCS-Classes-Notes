</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>

</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam. In order to pass, you need to pass the 70 question Objective Assessment and prove competency in the following subjects <b>Data Types</b> for 36%, <b>Data Structures</b> for 30%, and <b>Algorithms</b> for 34% of the assessment.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>This course used to show up very late in the program, behind even the <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C959.md">Discrete</a> <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C960.md">Math</a> classes, right before its partner class, C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms II. However, I've heard that it's recently been pushed up on the degree plan in a similar fashion that <a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/myBSCS-Classes-Notes/blob/main/C955.md">C955 - Applied Probability and Statistics</a> has. If your degree plan doesn't reflect this, I suggest asking your Program Mentor if you can take this soon rather than later, because it's actually the best introductory to programming in the degree program and the Zybooks is everything that you SHOULD be learning before you take on any big programming projects.</p>
<p>That said, this course is by no means difficult. It's not the deep dive into Data Structures and Algorithms that C950 is, but an overview of what Data Structures are, what types exists, how they work, and how they're implemented. You will learn about Algorithms in this course, but it's more akin to what are Algorithms, what are the different types, and what do they when used. You'll be mostly focusing on Searching and Sorting Algorithms in particular and they WILL make up a large portion of the Objective Assessment.</p>
<p>You'll also learn about Big-O, which is a formula for how Algorithm efficiency is measured. You won't need to memorize the Big-O notation of every Algorithm that exists, but you will need to understand how to recognize the notation from a given sample of code. Aside from Big-O and Searching and Sorting Algorithms, you should make sure to pay extra attention to Trees Traversals, and the properties of every Data Structure (what it is, how it works, what can/can't it do).</p>
<p>You won't need to memorize how everything is implemented in Python, in fact, you'll see more than just Python on the exam, but you will need to at least follow code samples. It may seem like a lot and rather difficult, but C949 if you follow Zybooks and read the other book I have listed below, everything I mentioned above will be easy. This course was originally intended to prepare you for  </p>

<h3>Learning Resources</h3>

<h5>Helpful Links:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/">Big-O Cheat Sheet</a> - While you learn about Big-O Notation from the below books, make sure to bookmark this for reference for both this class and C950.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/wgu.edu/eric-christiansen/home/C949?authuser=0">Eric Christiansen's C949 Supplemental Support Page</a> - You're going to see me reference this website a lot for the upper degree courses because it's a treasure trove of resources. Definitely bookmark it.</b></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> - While you won't actually be required to implement anything for the Objective Assessment or even program in Python, you will eventually need to. C949 was originally meant to be the course you learned Python for to use in C950, so I recommend at practicing before you have to. Freecodecamp has a course on Python and also one using Data Structures and Algorithms, but in JavaScript.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Krautpaddy/Python-SelfStudy-Notes">Python-SelfStudy-Notes</a> - I've begun to maintain a repository here for notes and sample code from my Python( including Data Structures I/II) learning resources. If you're interested in reading them, stay tuned.</li>

<h5>Textbooks:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/142888143">Data Structures and Algorithms I Zybooks</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the Zybooks for the class. It's a really fantastic textbook, I highly recommend reading it, at least up through Unit 10 where Big-O Notation is discussed. Then, Read the book below for the Algorithms requirement.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/a-common-sense-guide/9781680502794/">A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow</a> - This "plain English" book will teach you everything you're going to need about Searching and Sorting algorithms to meet the Algorithms portion of the exam. It's also a short read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart</a> - Although having a complete understanding of Python and its syntax isn't required for passing the Objective Assessment, I recommend taking the time to learn it since you WILL need to for C950 (which this class used to be the preparation for).</li>
