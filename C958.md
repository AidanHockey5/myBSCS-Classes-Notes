# C958 - Calculus I - 4cr
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
<li>None, although it is recommended you have taken Pre-Calculus beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Required For:</h5>
<ul>
<li>C959 - Discrete Mathematics I</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Final Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a final exam with 54 questions. In order to pass, you need to answer at least 37 questions correctly. The compentencies of the exam cover <b>Limits</b>, <b>Derivatives</b>, <b>Integrals</b>, and <b>Differential Equations</b>. Both Derivatives and Integrals cover more than half of what you will be tested on. Limits make up around 25% of what you'll be tested on and Differential Equations makes up less than 10%.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar to Calculus as I was upon starting this course, Calculus can become a huge block in your progress in the degree program. There's a reason colleges use Calculus as a "weeding out" of sorts for the sciences and engineering degrees. Even worse, this course actually covers both Calculus I and a large portion of Calculus II (Integrals). However, that isn't to say that this class is impossible. In fact, in the last few years, the college has been adding more resources for new students. As of writing this there's actually a daily online tutoring session you can join (the time varies by day).</p>
<p>My suggestion for handling this course is; if you have a good grasp of Calculus already, I would take a second to review Derivatives and Integrals, then give the Practice Assessment a shot. If you score well on it, you should be fine on the Final Exam. For those new to Calculus, I recommend immediately scheduling time every week with your assigned course mentor as you work through the zybooks. Having a teacher to simplify things for you is very helpful! Also, when you get to Unit 3, skip to the lesson on the Power Rule and then work through it.</p>
<p>If you think that you're going to never pass this class or that it's too scary, remember, some dummy has managed to pass this class before. That means YOU definitely can do it too.</p>
