<h5><b>Course Type:</b> Certification Exam</h5>
<p>This course uses a certification exam. In order to pass, you must use a voucher generated for you by WGU to sign up for the CIW's Site Development Associate certification and pass it. After you pass it, you'll need to send WGU your score report in order to receive credit for the course. If you already have the CIW Site Development Associate certification, you can transfer it in for credit for this course. The certification exam is 30 questions long with a cutoff score of 63.333% so you will need to answer about 20 questions correctly to pass.</p>

<h2>My Experiences with Class</h2>
<p>This will likely be another course that winds up in your first term at WGU. From the outside you would expect it to be a fun web development course, but in reality, the certification you're going to be taking for C779 will require you to know more about HTML5 standards and business practices than actual HTML or CSS code. That isn't to say you should refrain from learning anything about HTML or CSS, you will see some questions that require you to accurately fix or explain what a piece of code does. But learning the Business side of Web Dev is a far bigger chunk of this exam than you'll likely expect.</p>
<p>I came into this exam with years of experience with markup languages like HTML and CSS, so most of the code examples were easy for me. However, the business related questions did trip me up a bit. Unfortunately I had to retake this exam because, when I went to sign up for the exam the first time, I accidentally signed up for the CIW Web Foundations exam instead, which is a 90 question exam that covers the CIW Internet Business Associate, CIW Site Development Associate, and the CIW Network Technology Associate. So be careful when scheduling your exam!</p>

<h3>Learning Resources</h3>

<h5>Helpful Links:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a> - The website I first learned pre-HTML5 and CSS3, HTML and CSS from. This is a fantastic website for learning markup incrimentally. Every concept has sample code that you can test out and edit. The best part of learning markup is messing around with it! Oh, and don't forget to study the XML section.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> - Another fantastic website for learning HTML, CSS, and far more. It also helps that the Web Development curriculum includes an entire section on Applied Accessibility. You will be tested on Accessibility on the exam, and having a chance to learn by doing will help the whats and whys stick far better than the UCertify will.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ciwcertified.com/ciw-certifications/web-foundations-series/site-development-associate">CIW Site Development Associate Webpage</a> - The official page for the CIW Site Development Associate page is also quite helpful. Be sure to read the Exam Objectives and use each one as a guide for your studying.</li>
  <li><a href="https://quizlet.com/326320823/ciw-site-development-associate-flash-cards/">CIW Site Development Associate Quizlet</a> - Since the certification has a lot of vocabulary, using a Quizlet may help with memorizing some of the business jargon.</li>

<h5>Textbooks:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/85273497">CIW: Site Development Associate UCertify</a> - When you activate the course you'll immediately gain access to the UCertify for the class. It's definitely one of the dryer textbooks you'll have access to during the program. My recommendation is to skip actually reading it and use the test mode to gauge your prepardness for the exam while you use other learning resources.</li>
